<p>Hi, assalamualaikum! My name is Nurhaziera Najwa Binti Mohd Zaki. You can call me Zira. I am 23 years old and 4 days since my birthday is on 16 July hehe</p>

<p>By the way, I live in Seri Manjung, Perak with my family. I am the eldest from three (3) siblings. There are a boy which studying in UiTM Merbok, Kedah, and a girl which will face her SPM this year. My father works as a highway patrol at West Coast Expressway (WCE) while my mother is a housewife. I love all of them so much.</p>

<p style="color: rgb(190, 36, 87);font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif; font-size: 18px;">Other than that, I can speak Malay fluently and English very well. I have skills in Microsoft Word, Powerpoint and Excel. I am very committed and professional when it comes to work. Furthermore, I could say that I am a fast-learner person. I also love to work in team because I believe when we work together, it will bring more excellent outcome than working alone.</p>

<p>I first start my education at TABIKA KEMAS from 2005 to 2006. Then, I studied at SK Kampung Dato' Seri Kamaruddin from 2007 until 2012. I got 5A's in my UPSR. After that, I studied at SMK Kampung Dato' Seri Kamaruddin from 2013 to 2017 and I managed to get 5A, 2B and 2C for my SPM. Then,  work for a year before I decided to pursue my studies for Diploma in Banking Studies. I was chosen to study that course at UiTM Segamat, Johor from 2019 to 2020 before we had to study online at home since Covid-19 pandemic occured from 2020 to 2022. Currently, I pursue my Degree in Finance at UiTM Kota Bharu, Kelantan from 2022 until now. It is estimated for my batch to finish our Degree next year.</p>

<p>I also have working experiences. I first work as a cashier at TF-Value Mart Seri Manjung after I finished my secondary school with my classmate and met a lot of new friends. I worked there for six (6) months from December 2017 to June 2018. Then, I worked as a promoter at several companies at Aeon Mall Seri Manjung for like eight (8) months. At first, I only work as a part-time worker but then got a chance to be a permanent worker. However, the company had to be abolished. So, I try to find other job outside. Then, I worked as a sales assistant at 7-Eleven Seri Manjung for like two (2) months since I got an offer to pursue my studies. However, it is still online. So, I worked part-time at McDonalds Seri Manjung while study. Since we can study face-to-face now, I only work at McDonalds when I got some free time like semester break.</p>
